# ItsGettingHotter

Capstone project for Game Programming at Humber College. A climate change RTS game built in Unity3D.
Select units and assign them to necessary tasks before climate change destroys your progress! Prioritize carefully, as some tasks have a negative side effect on the health of the environment.
